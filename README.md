Welcome to the project! You've just cloned a fascinating web application that combines the power of Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. Let's get you started:

1.
The project is split into two main parts:
"angularapp": This is your Angular frontend, located in the angularapp directory.
"springapp": This is your Spring Boot backend, found in the springapp directory.
2.
For the Angular part:
Navigate to the angularapp directory.
Run npm install to get all the dependencies.
Use ng serve to start the development server. You can view the app at http://localhost:8081.
The main code is in the src folder. That's where you'll do most of your frontend work.
3.
For the Spring Boot part:
The springapp directory contains your Java backend.
It uses Maven for dependency management. The pom.xml file lists all the dependencies.
You can run the application using your IDE or Maven commands.
4.
To contribute:
For frontend changes, work in the angularapp/src directory.
For backend changes, look in the springapp/src directory.
Use ng generate component component-name to create new Angular components.
Remember to write tests for your changes. Use ng test for Angular and the appropriate testing framework for Spring Boot.
5.
The project uses modern web technologies like Angular 10, RxJS, and Bootstrap on the frontend, and Spring Boot with JPA on the backend.


Feel free to explore the code, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. Happy coding!
